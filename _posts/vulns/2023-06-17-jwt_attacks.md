**J**SON **W**eb **T**okens is a data format used to send data between the client and the server for authentication or authorization. <br> it’s useful as all data is stored on the client side rather than the server side.

# JWT Format

A JWT consists of 3 parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. each separated by a dot.

```json

```

## The Header
is a Base64url-encoded JSON object that contains metadata about the token itself like an algorithm.

## The Payload
is a Base64url-encoded JSON object that contains the actual data.

## The Signature
the signature is generated by hashing the header and the payload and then encrypting it.

As the signature is directly derived from the header and the payload, changing a single byte of the header or payload results in a mismatched signature so it helps to maintain integrity.

> Integrity is keeping the data not modified by an unauthorized person while transferring it.

Without knowing the server’s secret key, it shouldn’t be possible to generate the correct signature for a given header and payload.
