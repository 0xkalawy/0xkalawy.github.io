Hey folks, I‚Äôll explain how I got my first 3 paid bugs with Ahmed Ghazy.

before we go, our target is ‚Äúx.target.com‚Äù, as an alias ;)

# Recon

after hours of recon with:

- amass
- Security Trails
- httpx
- Dirsearch

I started to enumerate the IPs with:

```bash
while read subdomain;
do host $subdomain;
done < subdomains.txt
```

> As you know, the `host` command line utility performs simple DNS lookup, so resulted IP may belongs to a proxy or a third party. Therefore, it‚Äôs crucial to verify whether the IP is related to your target using (Whois, SSL Checker, etc) , or go deeper and search for the IP with other techniques :) <br> fortunately for our target it works well and give real IPs

# Scanning

I used to scan each IP with NMAP, specifically with the Vuln script:

```bash
while read ip;
do nmap -Pn $ip -p443,80,8080,8443,8000 --script=vuln;
done < ips.txt
```

> `vuln` is a category in NSE that contains useful scripts to check for common vulnerabilities

this gives me a result that says `/core/packages/: Directory Listing`

As a beginner who doesn‚Äôt know whether it should be reported or not, I was like:

So it‚Äôs time for a friend who will know for sure.

First, He told me that ‚Äúdirectory listing vulnerability should be reported since there is sensitive data‚Äù.

We spent hours exploring the content and these appear to be sensitive files.

While exploring, we got another directory vulnerable to the same bug. We started by reporting these two bugs and decided to go deeper and view the endpoints.

All endpoints weren‚Äôt worthy unless one `/core/xpdo/tools/schema/upgrade-mysql-1.1.php` which appears to be juicy.

viewing this endpoint for first-time results:

hmmm,

# Exploiting

what if adding `pkg` get-parameter:

the same message appears but with other parameters, ‚Ä¶

![image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*K3L_Ff5CPVQCGndstJARmw.png)

it works with the `pkg` parameter reflected, so it‚Äôs `<script>alert(‚ÄúXss_by_wego_1337‚Äù);</script>` time.

at this point, Ahmed Ghazy with the mindset of a real hacker decided to search with these files on GitHub in the hope of finding the source code.

As you expected, he succeeded:

![image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*FA65O8Z4yXuQiIAXN1GoPg.png)

after viewing the source code of `upgrade-mysql-1.1.php` , he found a `debug` parameter which exposes some sensitive data like database username and password, filesystem, and so on.

Do you think that he stopped here?

he started to search for the same bug in all subdomains and found the same bugs on the main domain ‚Äútarget.com‚Äù.

at the end of the day, we submitted 4 reports:

Debug Sensitive Data Exposure (Medium)
4 XSS (Medium), but we screwed up by submitting all in the same report
2 Directory listing (Medium), unfortunately, one of them was tagged as a duplicate to another.
After our submissions, the company removed the domain from the scope, later they deleted the whole domain, and all IPs are down now.
